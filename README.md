# KCETCollegePredictor
Repo for the Project - Karnataka Common Entrance Test College Predictor

The main objective of this idea is to help students to fill their preferences at the time of option-entry process accurately.  Ease of making better choices is our main motive. Rank, Category, Preferred Branches, Preferred Colleges and Preferred Districts are taken as input and the preference list, on thorough analysis of the last five yearsâ€™ cut-off data is generated. 

The app is built using:
1. Streamlit
2. Pandas
